# Predicting CpG Methylation Sites in *Arabidopsis thaliana* Chromosome 1

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict CpG methylation sites in **Arabidopsis thaliana** using **GC content** and **nucleotide composition**. The goal is to demonstrate that simple sequence-based features can provide strong predictive power, reducing reliance on costly experimental methods like bisulfite sequencing.


##  Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict CpG methylation status using only local sequence features.
- **Data**: Publicly available BEDGraph (methylation data) and FASTA (reference genome) files.
- **Models Used**: 
  - `SGDClassifier` from scikit-learn  
  - `XGBoost` for gradient-boosted decision trees
- **Outcome**: XGBoost achieved outstanding results with **97% precision/recall** and **AUC = 1.0**, proving the hypothesis.

## Key Methods

- Extract Â±50bp sequence windows around CpG sites
- Calculate GC content and nucleotide composition (A, T, G, C frequency)
- Generate balanced negative samples (non-CpG regions)
- Train and evaluate two classifiers
- Analyze performance metrics and feature importance

## Results

| Model        | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | AUC  |
|--------------|----------|-----------|--------|------|
| SGDClassifier | ~75%     | 0.77      | 0.72   | 0.84 |
| XGBoost       | ~97%     | 0.97      | 0.97   | 1.00 |

- GC content was consistently the most important feature across both models.
- XGBoost outperformed SGDClassifier by a wide margin.
